# Online-Library-Management-System

### Description
This project is an online library management system designed to streamline the process of borrowing and managing books. The system features three distinct interfaces:

- **User Interface**: Allows users to create accounts, discover the book catalog, search for books, view detailed information about books, borrow books, view their profile including borrowing history, and communicate with librarians.
- **Librarian Interface**: Provides librarians with tools to manage book inventory, handle user requests, and communicate with users.
- **Administrator Interface**: Enables administrators to manage both user and librarian accounts.
A standout feature of this project is the two-level login system that enhances security. Users first log in using traditional email and password authentication. Following this, they must pass a second authentication level involving face recognition, which utilizes the computer's or cell phone's camera.
